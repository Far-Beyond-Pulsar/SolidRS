//! [`SceneVisitor`] — a double-dispatch interface for walking a [`Scene`].
//!
//! Savers that want to serialise a scene without cloning it can implement
//! this trait and pass `&mut self` to [`Scene::visit`](crate::scene::Scene::visit).
//!
//! All methods have default no-op implementations so you only need to
//! override the ones you care about.
